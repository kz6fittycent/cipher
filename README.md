# ENCRYPTINATOR

A simple bash script that can encrypt and decrypt messages between friends

## Usage

### Encrypting a message

- From your terminal, run the script: `./encryptinator`
- Enter the message you want to encrypt, when prompted.
- Enter the password you'd like to use, when prompted.
- The script will create a new text file you can share with a friend. This text file has the encrypted message within.
- You'll need to share the password with your friend. This isn't very secure, but it's just for fun anyway. 

### Decrypting a message

- From your terminal, run the script: `./encryptinator`
- Enter the file location's full path that needs to be decrypted (e.g. `/home/$USER/file-to-be-decrypted.txt`).
- Enter the password that was shared with you.
- Laugh at the dumb message your friend decided to share.

### Future plans

- Create a more robust version with better security
- Create a snap that can be installed and updated easily
- Kick it to the man
- `U2FsdGVkX1+C3k5hrdikpIoRCGZXXu+SpVcOWcI1BrgWTBwJ+v7mjL67Ueq4xpqP` <- Created with ENCRYPTINATOR
